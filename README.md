# fetch_assessment

Greetings! I was able to get the machine up and running but was having problems sshing into the machine because of the port and the user1 and user2 public keys. I commented out the key.pem because I kept snagging an error. I'm still learning and would love to learn more, hopefully with this apprenticeship! 

Below are instructions to get the machine up and running!



# In order to launch EC2 instance from your computer make sure to install boto3, python3, awscli, and pyyaml on your terminal. The link below helped me tons!
# https://www.ipswitch.com/blog/how-to-create-an-ec2-instance-with-python
# pip install awscli boto3
# pip install pyyaml
# using the link above as reference I created a user and chose programmatic access and set permissions to 'AmazonEC2FullAccess'.
# then run the code by entering 'python ec2_fetch.py'

Here are some the links I used to guild me in the right direction.
